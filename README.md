BERGCloud Bridge Stand
===============

A stand for your BERGCloud Bridge. Can be laser-cut or made manually, if you want.

Dimensions: 280mm x 85mm.

You'll need to use a low-profile ethernet cable and remove the anti-interference collar on the power cable.

If cutting with Ethos, set red to Cut-through, and black to engrave.

Line bend the acrylic where to two engrave marks are down the edge.
